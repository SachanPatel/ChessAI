# ChessAI
We are developing an AI to play chess. It is going to use the minimax algorithm as well as alpha beta pruning. It is also going to consider the location of the pieces for the evaluation function.
We can implement a registered bot account on lichess.org and test it to evaluate its rank and performance
We use the minimax algorithm and alpha beta pruning. 
we also weight the center squares to hold value when controlled
We used a bitboard to implement our game
